# Xtreme Website

This project is based on an open-source HTML and CSS template, which I used as a foundation to build a Xtreme-named website. The goal was to practice front-end development by working with an existing template, understanding its structure, and customizing it to create a visually appealing. This process helped me improve my skills in HTML structure, CSS styling, and responsive design.
